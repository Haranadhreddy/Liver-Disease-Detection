# Liver Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a reliable machine learning framework for diagnosing liver cirrhosis. Using a dataset published on Kaggle, we explore the effectiveness of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Logistic Regression models in classifying patients with liver cirrhosis. The dataset includes key indicators like age, gender, liver function tests, and protein levels, crucial for predicting liver health.

## Data

The dataset consists of medical data from 583 patients, featuring details such as Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Alkaline Phosphatase, and more. A significant challenge in this dataset is its imbalance and the presence of outliers, which we addressed through various preprocessing techniques.

## Methods

We used KNN and Logistic Regression models, focusing on hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation to enhance predictive accuracy. The project also involved exploratory data analysis using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to understand data distribution and feature correlations.

## Results

Our preliminary results show an average accuracy of approximately 65% for the KNN model and slightly higher for Logistic Regression. These models demonstrate the complexities of medical data analysis and the need for sophisticated model tuning.

## Conclusions

This project highlights the potential of machine learning in medical diagnostics, particularly in non-invasive testing which could significantly improve early detection and patient outcomes in liver disease.
